# Learning YAML! 

Just messing around with YAML here. Think of this as my YAML practice space.

What's inside:

1. My YAML experiments (lots of different files!).
2. Maybe some notes on what I'm figuring out.

Why YAML?

Seems like a handy skill for setting things up. So, I'm giving it a go!

My Goal:

To get good at writing and reading YAML.

Keep an eye out!

I'll be adding stuff as I learn. Feel free to check it out. Maybe you're learning YAML too? ðŸ˜Š

That's the gist of it for now! Happy coding! ðŸ¤“
